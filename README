NAME
    Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client - Riap::HTTP client

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.20 of Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client
    (from Perl distribution Perinci-Access-HTTP-Client), released on
    2014-10-23.

SYNOPSIS
     use Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client;
     my $pa = Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client->new;

     ## perform Riap requests

     # list all functions in package
     my $res = $pa->request(list => 'http://localhost:5000/api/',
                            {uri=>'/Some/Module/', type=>'function'});
     # -> [200, "OK", ['/Some/Module/mult2', '/Some/Module/mult2']]

     # call function
     $res = $pa->request(call => 'http://localhost:5000/api/',
                         {uri=>'/Some/Module/mult2', args=>{a=>2, b=>3}});
     # -> [200, "OK", 6]

     # get function metadata
     $res = $pa->request(meta => 'http://localhost:5000/api/',
                         {uri=>'/Foo/Bar/multn'});
     # -> [200, "OK", {v=>1.1, summary=>'Multiple many numbers', ...}]

     # pass HTTP credentials (via object attribute)
     my $pa = Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client->new(user => 'admin', password=>'123');
     my $res = $pa->request(call => '...', {...});
     # -> [200, "OK", 'result']

     # HTTP credentials can also be passed on a per-request basis
     my $pa = Perinci::Access::HTTP::Client->new();
     my $res = $pa->request(call => '...', {...}, {user=>'admin', password=>'123'});

     ## parse server URL
     $res = $pa->parse_url("https://cpanlists.org/api/"); # {proto=>"https", path=>"/App/cpanlists/Server/"}

DESCRIPTION
    This class implements Riap::HTTP client.

    This class uses Log::Any for logging.

ATTRIBUTES
    *   realm => STR

        For HTTP basic authentication. Defaults to "restricted area" (this
        is the default realm used by Plack::Middleware::Auth::Basic).

    *   user => STR

        For HTTP basic authentication. Default will be taken from
        environment "PERINCI_HTTP_USER".

    *   password => STR

        For HTTP basic authentication. Default will be taken from
        environment "PERINCI_HTTP_PASSWORD".

    *   ssl_cert_file => STR

        Path to SSL client certificate. Default will be taken from
        environment "SSL_CERT_FILE".

    *   ssl_cert_file => STR

        Path to SSL CA certificate. Default will be taken from environment
        "SSL_CA_FILE".

METHODS
  PKG->new(%attrs) => OBJ
    Instantiate object. Known attributes:

    *   retries => INT (default 2)

        Number of retries to do on network failure. Setting it to 0 will
        disable retries.

    *   retry_delay => INT (default 3)

        Number of seconds to wait between retries.

    *   log_level => INT (default 0 or from environment)

        Will be fed into Riap request key 'loglevel' (if >0). Note that some
        servers might forbid setting log level.

        If TRACE environment variable is true, default log_level will be set
        to 6. If DEBUG, 5. If VERBOSE, 4. If quiet, 1. Else 0.

    *   log_callback => CODE

        Pass log messages from the server to this subroutine. If not
        specified, log messages will be "rethrown" into Log::Any logging
        methods (e.g. $log->warn(), $log->debug(), etc).

  $pa->request($action => $server_url[, \%extra_keys[, \%client_opts]]) => $res
    Send Riap request to $server_url. Note that $server_url is the HTTP URL
    of Riap server. You will need to specify code entity URI via "uri" key
    in %extra_keys.

    %extra_keys is optional and contains additional Riap request keys
    (except "action", which is taken from $action).

    %client_opts is optional and contains additional information, like
    "user" (HTTP authentication user, overrides one in object attribute),
    "password" (HTTP authentication user, overrides one in object
    attribute).

  $pa->parse_url($server_url[, \%client_opts]) => HASH
ENVIRONMENT
    "PERINCI_HTTP_USER".

    "PERINCI_HTTP_PASSWORD".

    "SSL_CERT_FILE", "SSL_CA_FILE".

FAQ
  How do I connect to a HTTP server that listens on a Unix socket?
    This class can switch to using LWP::Protocol::http::SocketUnixAlt when
    it detects that the server is on a Unix socket, using this syntax
    (notice the single instead of double slash after "http:"):

     http:/path/to/unix.sock//uri

  How do I connect to an HTTPS server without a "real" SSL certificate?
    Since this module is using LWP, you can set environment variable
    "PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME" to 0. See LWP for more details.
